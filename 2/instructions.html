<p>We are creating product review templates. Your task is to identify and describe the two most important features to consider when buying a recreational drone that can carry a high definition camera. We will be selecting some of the feature descriptions from these HITs to include in our product review template. Other Turkers will be rating your descriptions based on 1) how important the features are to someone looking to buy this product and 2) how easy it is to understand your descriptions of the features. Each description rated in the top 50% of submissions will receive a bonus payment.</p>

<p>In this task, you will use our search engine on the top of the screen to help you figure out which two features are the most important. For each of the two features, write a sentence in the textbox on the right side of the screen clearly describing the feature and another sentence explaining why the feature is important. Please do not use any other search engines or open up new browser windows. When you are done creating your feature descriptions, click the button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>Clicking "Submit Descriptions and Search History" will send your descriptions and search history on to other Turkers for evaluation.</p>

<p>Then take a short survey to complete your task.<p/>

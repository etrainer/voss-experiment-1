<p>In this task, you will use our search engine on the top of the screen to identify the two most important features of a [PRODUCT TYPE AND USE]. Write a sentence in the [ETHERPAD/FORM] on the right side of the screen describing the feature you choose and another sentence explaining why the feature is important. Please do not use any other search engines or open up new tabs. When you are done creating your feature descriptions, click the "submit" button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>Clicking "submit" will send your description and saved search history on for evaluation (you will have the opportunity to edit your search history before it is sent).</p>

<p>After clicking "submit" you will be asked to complete a short survey.</p>

<p>We are creating product review templates. We will be selecting some of the feature descriptions from these HITs to include in our product review template.<p/>

<p>[Another Turker] will evaluate your description text against [criteria, e.g., well-written, well-justified], and will also have your saved search history. If the other Turkers rate yours as one of the top 50%, you will receive a bonus payment of [2x/3x?].</p>
